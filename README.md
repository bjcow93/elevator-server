I completed the tests using Go. There were some intial configuration issues while setting up the repository and installing some of the tools, so I had to make a couple changes in configure_lifty.go. I made a file called configure_lifty.diff to show what I changed. If anyone else reaches out with configuration issues in the future, I hope this will help!
